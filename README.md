# EoS-Processes
Breakdown of the current state of EoS Processes

There are currently four processes that we are documenting:

- PLP Converter - Field Item Importer
- Contract Information Input
- START Input
- User Defined Fields Input

All of these will get there own folders in the EoS-Processes folder.

The goal is to populate the staging tables correctly and have them exported into the eCMS Database.
