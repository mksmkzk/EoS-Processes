# Contract Information Input

We used SILVER DOLLAR AREA 3 from DIVISION 6 for this particular example on the dev server.

## Purpose

Populate the contract information from the current contract with information regarding each plan and elevation.

## Process

Right click on an estimate and go to 'eCMS Integration' -> 'Input Contract Information'


## Issues

We want the forms to populate into a specific folder (16 Input Forms).

### Dev Environment


- The procedure seems to be grouping on footprint quantity 

### Production Environment

Not tested on the production server.
